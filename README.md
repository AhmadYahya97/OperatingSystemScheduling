# Operating System Scheduling
This is Operating Systems project. 
The project idea is to generate a randomly uniform steam of jobs as the first stage.
Then in the second stage we will pick a scheduling algorithms out of the most 6 commonly used algorithms.
after this we will make a comparison of which algorithm performed better on which data.

as a Bonus part we designed an interactive user interface so the project can be used later for educational uses.

in the UI the progress of each job the progress of the whole system can be seen.

The implemented algorithms: 
 - First-Come, First-Served FCFS Scheduling
 - Shortest-Job-First SJF Scheduling
 - Shortest Remaining Time
 - Priority Scheduling
 - Round Robin - RR Scheduling
